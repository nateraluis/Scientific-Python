# Scientific-Python
Final project for scientific python course.

For the final project I worked with cycleway networks, using the python library OSMnx to download data from open street map and convert it to a network object. The main goal was to analyse the how complete the network is, in order to do this I did the following:

    1. Get the data from open street map and generate a network.
    2. Plot the street infraestucture that is contained in the network (types of streets)
    3. Plot the possible walking and biking distances from the centermost node.
    4. Get the cycleways network 4.1. Plot the cycleways network 4.2. Plot the possible walking and biking distances using only the cycleways network
    5. Compare the two networks in terms of kilometers
    6. Plot the cycleways network over the general network
    7. Calculate the cycleway kilometers for every weakly connected component in the cycleway network
    8. Get the basic statistics (OSMnx) for every weakly connected component.
